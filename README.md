Portfolio 2: Security Audit for Botium Toys

# Security Audit for Botium Toys

## Introduction

Botium Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales, faced growing challenges in maintaining cybersecurity as their online presence expanded. This portfolio section details my role in conducting an internal security audit to assess and improve their IT infrastructure's security posture.

## Scope and Objectives

The audit scope included evaluating IT controls, assessing compliance with online payment processing regulations, and ensuring alignment with EU business operations requirements. Objectives focused on identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and enhancing overall security measures.

## Methodology
I utilized the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to structure the audit. This involved reviewing existing policies and procedures, conducting interviews with IT staff, and performing technical assessments to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in security controls.

## Findings
  - revealed vulnerabilities in network segmentation
  - inadequate access controls, and gaps in compliance with PCI DSS requirements for online payment processing.
  - strong encryption practices and regular backup procedures were identified as effective measures.

## Recommendations
 - implementing network segmentation to isolate sensitive data
 - enhancing access control mechanisms through multi-factor authentication
 - conducting regular vulnerability assessments
 - penetration testing. Additionally
 - enhancing staff training on cybersecurity best practices is advised to mitigate human error
